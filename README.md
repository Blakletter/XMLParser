### Hello, welcome to my XML parser library :grin:

This library gives you the ability to load in xml, navigate and change the structure using a node based approach, and export the nodes back out into xml.

This library was created for fun, as a challenge, and because there are always better ways to make things work.

### Getting started

Clone this repository to a directory of your choosing, or just download it as a zip and extract it.

Run the main method in Main.java and you are good to go! Or go ahead and import
