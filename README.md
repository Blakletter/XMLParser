### Hello, welcome to my XML parser library :grin:

This library gives you the ability to load in xml, navigate and change the structure using a node based approach, and export the nodes back out into xml.

This library was created for fun, as a challenge, and because there are always better ways to make things work.

### Getting started

Clone the repo and run the main method in Main.java.
