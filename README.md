### Hello, welcome to my XML parser library :grin:

This library gives you the ability to load in xml, navigate and change the structure using a node based approach, and export the nodes back out into xml.

This library was created for fun, as a challenge, and because there are always better ways to make things work.

### Getting started

Clone this repository to a directory of your choosing, or just download it as a zip and extract it.

Next, in the Main.java main method, there is a simple implementation for you already.
Simply define the absolute path to an xml file and press run. It will take the xml, load it into its structure, and print it back out.

Methods and returns:
